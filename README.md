# Edit-Distance-Algorithms-in-C-

This project demonstrates four different approaches to computing the Edit Distance (Levenshtein Distance) between two strings:

1-Brute Force Recursive

2-Memoized Recursive (Top-Down Dynamic Programming)

3-Bottom-Up Dynamic Programming

4-Divide and Conquer using Space-Efficient DP (Hirschberg's Algorithm variant)
